(0) 2 make your working directory a git repository - non-bare repo (repository with a working directory)
    a. locate yourself in your root project directory
    b. execute the following command
    
    rosemary@kali:~/JPAT/SCUBA$ git init

(1) make your .gitignore configurations 
    at same directory make a new file named '.gitignore' and add the following and plus more you might wish

    build/
    build.eclipse/
    build.ant/
    bin/
    RemoteSystemsTempFiles/
    .directory
    .gradle/
    .settings/
    *.log
    .metadata/

(2) Add the contents you want to control as follows
    git add *.*
(3) make sure that there is no folder is missed, for example a non-dev project like master/, favourites/ and .gitignore need to be added explicitly after executing git add *.*
    git add master/
    git add .gitignore
    git add favourites/
    

(4) commit your staged files
    git commit -m "initialized a non-bare repo - a repo with a working directory"
    
Now, you might need to instantiate a Server Git Repo - bare repo

(5) Suppose you want your server git repo on some local disk 
    
    (a) Make the directory x.git in some path as follows
    
    mkdir scuba.git
    cd suba.git
    git --bare init

(6) Now, go back to your working directory (non-bare repo)
    (a) add a remote git repo - which is the one we made in step 5
    
    git remote add origin file:///path/to/scuba.git
    
    rosemary@kali:~/scrap$ git remote add origin file:///home/rosemary/repo/JPAT/scuba.git
    
    
(7) You are ready 2 push your source code to the new Server git repo, as follows
    git push origin master
    
    rosemary@kali:~/scrap$ git push origin master


in case you forgot to add to ignore certain artefacts, here what you could do as examples:

root@kali:/home/rosemary/JPAT-ROSEMARY/SCUBA# git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch **/.classpath
root@kali:/home/rosemary/JPAT-ROSEMARY/SCUBA# git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch **/.project
root@kali:/home/rosemary/JPAT-ROSEMARY/SCUBA# git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch **/.gradle/
